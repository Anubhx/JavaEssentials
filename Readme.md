## Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

### Features of Java
- **Simple**: Java's syntax is easy to learn and its code is easy to read.
- **Object-Oriented**: Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm which makes it more flexible, modular, and scalable.
- **Platform-Independent**: Java code is compiled into bytecode that can run on any device equipped with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Secure**: Java has built-in security features such as bytecode verification and a security manager.
- **Robust**: Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection.

## Java History

Java was developed by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) in 1991. Initially called Oak, the language was designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The project was later renamed to Java, inspired by Java coffee.

### Key Milestones
- **1995**: Java 1.0 released by Sun Microsystems.
- **1996**: Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0 released.
- **1999**: Java 2 (also known as J2SE 1.2) released with major enhancements.
- **2004**: J2SE 5.0 released, introduced generics, metadata, enumerated types, and the enhanced for loop.
- **2014**: Java 8 released, introduced lambda expressions and the Stream API.
- **2017**: Java 9 released, introduced the Java Platform Module System.
